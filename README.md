# ziglyph
Unicode processing with Zig, and a UTF-8 string type: [Zigstr](src/zigstr).

## Status
This is pre-1.0 software. Althogh breaking changes are less frequent with each minor version release,
they still will occur until we reach 1.0.

## Background
This library has been built from scratch in Zig. Although initially inspired by the Go `unicode`
package, Ziglyph is now completely independent and unique in and of itself.

### The Zigstr String Type
`Zigstr` is a UTF-8 string type that incorporates many of Ziglyph's Unicode processing tools. You can
learn more in the [Zigstr subdirectory](src/zigstr).

## Integrating Ziglyph in your Project
In a `libs` subdirectory under the root of your project, clone this repository via

```sh
$  git clone https://github.com/jecolon/ziglyph.git
```

Now in your build.zig, you can add:

```zig
exe.addPackagePath("Ziglyph", "libs/ziglyph/src/ziglyph.zig");
```

to the `exe` section for the executable where you wish to have Ziglyph available. Now in the code, you
can import components like this:

```zig
const Ziglyph = @import("Ziglyph").Ziglyph;
const Letter = @import("Ziglyph").Letter;
const Number = @import("Ziglyph").Number;
```

Finally, you can build the project with:

```sh
$ zig build
```

Note that to build in realase modes, either specify them in the `build.zig` file or on the command line
via the `-Drelease-fast=true`, `-Drelease-small=true`, `-Drelease-safe=true` options to `zig build`.

### Using the Ziglyph Struct
The `Ziglyph` struct provides convenient acces to the most frequently-used functions related to Unicode.

```zig
const Ziglyph = @import("Ziglyph").Ziglyph;

test "Ziglyph struct" {
    var ziglyph = Ziglyph.new();

    const z = 'z';
    expect(ziglyph.isLetter(z));
    expect(ziglyph.isAlphaNum(z));
    expect(ziglyph.isPrint(z));
    expect(!ziglyph.isUpper(z));
    const uz = ziglyph.toUpper(z);
    expect(ziglyph.isUpper(uz));
    expectEqual(uz, 'Z');
}
```

### Using the aggregate Structs
The `Ziglyph` struct is convenient, but requires a large memory and binary footprint to provide its 
varied functionality. For more control over memory and binary size, smaller aggregate structs are 
privided.

```zig
const Letter = @import("Ziglyph").Letter;
const Punct = @import("Ziglyph").Punct;

test "Aggregate struct" {
    var letter = Letter.new();
    var punct = Punct.new();

    const z = 'z';
    expect(letter.isLetter(z));
    expect(!letter.isUpper(z));
    expect(!punct.isPunct(z));
    expect(punct.isPunct('!'));
    const uz = letter.toUpper(z);
    expect(letter.isUpper(uz));
    expectEqual(uz, 'Z');
}
```

## Normalization
In addition to the basic functions to detect and convert code point case, the `Normalizer` struct 
provides code point and string normalization methods. This library currently only 
performs full canonical and compatibility decomposition and normalization (NFD and NFKD). Future 
versions may add more normalization forms.

```zig
const Normalizer = @import("Ziglyph").Normalizer;

test "normalizeTo" {
    var allocator = std.testing.allocator;
    var normalizer = Normalizer.new();

    // Canonical (NFD)
    var input = "Complex char: \u{03D3}";
    var want = "Complex char: \u{03D2}\u{0301}";
    var got = try normalizer.normalizeTo(allocator, .D, input);
    defer allocator.free(got);
    expectEqualSlices(u8, want, got);
    allocator.free(got);

    // Compatibility (NFKD)
    input = "Complex char: \u{03D3}";
    want = "Complex char: \u{03A5}\u{0301}";
    got = try normalizer.normalizeTo(allocator, .KD, input);
    expectEqualSlices(u8, want, got);

    // String comparisons.
    expect(try normalizer.eqlBy("foÃ©", "foe\u{0301}", .normalize));
    expect(try normalizer.eqlBy("foÏ“", "fo\u{03D2}\u{0301}", .normalize));
    expect(try normalizer.eqlBy("FoÏ“", "fo\u{03D2}\u{0301}", .norm_ignore));
    expect(try normalizer.eqlBy("FOÃ‰", "foe\u{0301}", .norm_ignore)); // foÃ‰ == foÃ©
}
```

## Grapheme Clusters
Many programming languages and libraries provide a basic `Character` or `char` type to represent what
we normally consider to be the characters that we see printed out composing strings of text. Unfortunately,
these implementations map these types to what Unicode calls a *code point*, which is only correct if 
you're working with basic latin letters and numbers, mostly in the ASCII character set space. When 
dealing with the vast majority of other languages, code points do not map directly to what we would 
consider *characters* of a string, but rather a single visible character can be composed of many code points,
combined to form a single human-readable character. In Unicode, these combinations of code points are
called *Grapheme Clusters* and Ziglyph provides the `GraphemeIterator` to extract individual *characters* 
(not just single code points) from a string.

```
const GraphemeIterator = @import("Ziglyph").GraphemeIterator;

test "GraphemeIterator" {
    var giter = try GraphemeIterator.new("H\u{0065}\u{0301}llo");

    const want = &[_][]const u8{ "H", "\u{0065}\u{0301}", "l", "l", "o" };

    var i: usize = 0;
    while (giter.next()) |gc| : (i += 1) {
        expect(gc.eql(want[i]));
    }
}
```

## Code Point and String Width
When working with environments in which text is rendered in a fixed-width font, such as terminal 
emulators, it's necessary to know how many cells (or columns) a particular code point or string will
occupy. The `Width` component struct provides methods to do just that.

```
const Width = @import("Ziglyph").Width;

test "Code point / string widths" {
    var width = Width.new();

    // The width methods take a second parameter of value .half or .full to determine the width of 
    // ambiguous code points as per the Unicode standard. .half is the most common case.
    expectEqual(width.codePointWidth('Ã©', .half), 1);
    expectEqual(width.codePointWidth('ðŸ˜Š', .half), 2);
    expectEqual(width.codePointWidth('ç»Ÿ', .half), 2);
    expectEqual(try width.strWidth("Hello\r\n", .half), 5);
    expectEqual(try width.strWidth("\u{1F476}\u{1F3FF}\u{0308}\u{200D}\u{1F476}\u{1F3FF}", .half), 2);
    expectEqual(try width.strWidth("HÃ©llo ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸", .half), 8);
    expectEqual(try width.strWidth("\u{26A1}\u{FE0E}", .half), 1); // Text sequence
    expectEqual(try width.strWidth("\u{26A1}\u{FE0F}", .half), 2); // Presentation sequence
}
```

## Collation (String Ordering)
One of the most common operations required by string processing is sorting and ordering comparisons.
The Unicode Collation Algorithm was developed to attend this area of string processing. The `Collator`
struct implements the algorithm, allowing for proper sorting and order comparison of Unicode strings.
The `init` function requires the path to the file with the Unicode sort keys, which can be found at
http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/latest/allkeys.txt . A copy of this file can be found in the 
`src/data/uca` directory.

```
const Collator = @import("Ziglyph").Collator;

test "Collation" {
    var allocator = std.testing.allocator;
    var collator = try Collator.init(allocator, "path/to/allkeys.txt");
    defer collator.deinit();

    expect(try collator.lessThan("abc", "def"));
    var strings: [3][]const u8 = .{ "xyz", "def", "abc" };
    collator.sort(&strings);
    expectEqual(strings[0], "abc");
    expectEqual(strings[1], "def");
    expectEqual(strings[2], "xyz");
}
```

## Unicode Data
The Unicode data is the latest available on the Unicode website, and can be refreshed via the 
`ucd_gen.sh` script in the root directory (must be run in the root directory to generate files in the 
proper locations.) [LICENSE](src/data/ucd/LICENSE-UNICODE)
