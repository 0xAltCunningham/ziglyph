# ziglyph
Unicode processing with Zig. This started as a direct translation of the Go unicode base package 
from the Go standard library. Still wohk to be done, to make it more idiomatic Zig, but 
practiacally all basic feature tests are now passing. See [src/main.zig](src/main.zig) for 
sample usage in the tests.
