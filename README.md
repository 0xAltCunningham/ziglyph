# ziglyph
Unicode processing with Zig. This is mostly a direct translation of the Go unicode base package 
from the Go standard library.  Still some work to be done, to make it more idiomatic Zig, but 
practiacally all critical Go tests are now passing in Zig. See [src/main.zig](src/main.zig) for 
sample usage in the tests.
